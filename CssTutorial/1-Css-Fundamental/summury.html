    <h4>CSS tutorial</h4>
    <p>in general there</p>
    <ol>
      <li>inline CSS</li>
      <li>external CSS</li>
      <li>internal CSS</li>
    </ol>

    <p>
      there are downside of using internal and inline css you gona end up using
      external css
    </p>
    <p>
      inline css are added to the html tag by adding
      <strong><em>Style attribute</em></strong>
      it really hard to maintain specially for large project
      <br />
      <code style="border: 1px solid">
        h1 { color: rebeccapurple; font-size: 50px; } <br />
        h2 { color: chocolate; font-size: 8px; }
      </code>
    </p>
    <h4>Power Struggle</h4>
    <p> take note that when there is conflict between diffrenet CSS 
        it's alway handled with the system
        <ol>
            <li>inline</li>
            <li>internal</li>

        </ol>
        <br>
        need to pay attention the last element will take effect 
        so for example if you have 
    </p>

    <h3>Inheritance</h3>
    <p>children inherit styles from parent unless they have their own style defined
      <br>
      this is only applies to the properties that are matching
      <br>
      some properties are not inherited as border and need to be set by the child element 
        border: 3px solid black;
    </p>
    <p>/* Last Rule and specificity * Universal selector*/
      <ul>
        <li><h4>          Last Rule</h4> <p>
           if you setup rule at the beginning of the file 
      and then you add the same rule after it in the bottom
      the last rule will be applied
        </p></li>
        <li>
          <h3>Selector specificity</h3>
          <p>If there are two or more CSS rules that point to the same element, the selector with the highest specificity value will "win", and its style declaration will be applied to that HTML element.</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Inline styles  Example: <h1 style="color: pink;"></h1> </li>
            <li>id selector IDs - Example: #navbar</li>
            <li> Classes, pseudo-classes, attribute selectors - Example: .test, :hover, [href]</li>
          <li>Elements and pseudo-elements - Example: h1, ::before</li>
          </ol>
          <p><strong>The selector with the highest specificity value will win and take effect!</strong></p>

        </li>
        <li>
          <h4>* Universal selector</h4>
          this is the last one that have specificity and 


          usually used to get ride of the the browser default values so
        </li>
      </ul>
     
    </p>
